# AI-Car-Parking-System
This is my B.Tech last year project.


This paper introduce a car parking system synchronized with an application. 
In big cities many of us do not enjoy standing in long queues waiting for the parking space to be alloted. 
This project can be implemented in malls, metro stations, etc. To fasten the parking process.

This parking system have car identification and number plate recognition using machine learning and real time updation of available slots in application. 
Pre-booking is also available through the application. 

If any vehicle in front of the entry gate, using machine learning it will identify the vehicle. 
If it is a car, then identify the vehicle number and record the number and entry time and  the gate will open if the parking space is available. 
The system will calculate the available slot through minimize the used space from total space.

We have an application and it will updated the information of available slots in real-time. 
We can create an account through the E-mail address or phone number and many of us have more than one vehicle so we can add the number of vehicles in one account. 
In the way out gate has an another camera and it will read the vehicle number and calculate the amount of payment. 
It has a wallet in the app and we can add money to this wallet. 
So when we leave from the exit gate we can pay through the application. 
If the vehicle not registered in the app, we can pay through online using the QR code provided in the parking place.
